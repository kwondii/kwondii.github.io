    <h2>When it was the Five Hundred and Forty-second Night,</h2>
    <p>She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Sindbad the Seaman 
        said to the captain, “These bales are mine, the goods which Allah hath given me,” 
        the other exclaimed, “There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the 
        Glorious, the Great! Verily, there is neither conscience nor good faith left among 
        men!” said I, “O Rais, what mean these words, seeing that I have told thee my case?” 
        And he answered, “Because thou heardest me say that I had with me goods whose owner 
        was drowned, thou thinkest to take them without right; but this is forbidden by law 
        to thee, for we saw him drown before our eyes, together with many other passengers, 
        nor was one of them saved. So how canst thou pretend that thou art the owner of the 
        goods?” “O captain,” said I, “listen to my story and give heed to my words, and my 
        truth will be manifest to thee; for lying and leasing are the letter-marks of the 
        hypocrites.” Then I recounted to him all that had befallen me since I sailed from 
        Baghdad with him to the time when we came to the fish-island where we were nearly 
        drowned; and I reminded him of certain matters which had passed between us; whereupon 
        both he and the merchants were certified at the truth of my story and recognized me 
        and gave me joy of my deliverance, saying, “By Allah, we thought not that thou hadst 
        escaped drowning! But the Lord hath granted thee new life.” Then they delivered my 
        bales to me, and I found my name written thereon, nor was aught thereof lacking. So I 
        opened them and making up a present for King Mihrjan of the finest and costliest of 
        the contents, caused the sailors carry it up to the palace, where I went in to the 
        King and laid my present at his feet, acquainting him with what had happened, 
        especially concerning the ship and my goods; whereat he wondered with exceeding 
        wonder and the truth of all that I had told him was made manifest to him. His 
        affection for me redoubled after that and he showed me exceeding honour and bestowed 
        on me a great present in return for mine. Then I sold my bales and what other 
        matters I owned making a great profit on them, and bought me other goods and gear of 
        the growth and fashion of the island-city. When the merchants were about to start on 
        their homeward voyage, I embarked on board the ship all that I possessed, and going 
        in to the King, thanked him for all his favours and friendship and craved his leave 
        to return to my own land and friends. He farewelled me and bestowed on me great store 
        of the country-stuffs and produce; and I took leave of him and embarked. Then we set 
        sail and fared on nights and days, by the permission of Allah Almighty; and Fortune 
        served us and Fate favoured us, so that we arrived in safety at Bassorah-city where 
        I landed rejoiced at my safe return to my natal soil. After a short stay, I set out 
        for Baghdad, the House of Peace, with store of goods and commodities of great price. 
        Reaching the city in due time, I went straight to my own quarter and entered my 
        house where all my friends and kinsfolk came to greet me. Then I bought me eunuchs 
        and concubines, servants and negro slaves till I had a large establishment, and I 
        bought me houses, and lands and gardens, till I was richer and in better case than 
        before, and returned to enjoy the society of my friends and familiars more 
        assiduously than ever, forgetting all I had suffered of fatigue and hardship and 
        strangerhood and every peril of travel; and I applied myself to all manner joys and 
        solaces and delights, eating the dantiest viands and drinking the deliciousest 
        wines; and my wealth allowed this state of things to endure. “This, then, is the 
        story of my first voyage, and to-morrow, Inshallah! I will tell you the tale of the 
        second of my seven voyages.” (Saith he who telleth the tale), Then Sindbad the 
        Seaman made Sindbad the Landsman sup with him and bade give him an hundred gold 
        pieces, saying, “Thou hast cheered us with thy company this day.” The Porter 
        thanked him and, taking the gift, went his way, pondering that which he had heard 
        and marvelling mightily at what things betide mankind. He passed the night in his 
        own place and with early morning repaired to the abode of Sindbad the Seaman, who 
        received him with honour and seated him by his side. As soon as the rest of the 
        company was assembled, he set meat and drink before them and, when they had well 
        eaten and drunken and were merry and in cheerful case, he took up his discourse and 
        recounted to them in these words the narrative of…</p>
